# DFA-Creator
Creates DFA's at run time with user input
This program takes user choices to create a regular language that can be tested with any amount of strings. These strings they test will result in 
ether a error or a success (meaning the string is within the domain of the language they created).
It uses a 2D array to creat a DFA at runtime. The DFA is then used to create the users dream language. 

How to use: Follow the prompts on the command line. input strings untill satisfied.
